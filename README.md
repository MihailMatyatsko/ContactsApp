# ContactsApp
One of the first UI apps in Swift from me)


As a beginner i've always tryed to find some easily written code, with comments and all other, which was nessessary to me.
I would be even glad if someone, will find solution to his/her problem, and will use it it his/her project.

I do not really know, what else i can write here. Maybe some concrete information...

- all contacts data is saved in .plist file
- for interaction with this files, you will find special class - Plist File Manager.
- in general, here you can find used userDefaults, TableView, some sorting, model data classes and a lot of IBOutlets from storyboard)
